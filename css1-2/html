                    The Magic of Glowing Creatures 
                </div>

                <p id="large">
                    Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. 
                    It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. 
                    It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!

                    <p id="text5">
                        <p id="tx6">1. A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</p>
                        <p id="tx7">2. An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</p>
                        <p id="tx8">3. Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “coldlight.”</p>
