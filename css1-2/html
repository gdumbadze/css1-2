        <div id="text7">Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. 
            It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. 
            It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!</div>

        <div id="text8">Here’s how it works:</div>

        <div id="text9">1. A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.
            2. An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.
            3. Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</div>
